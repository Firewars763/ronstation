  # Metashield
  Something that is "shielded" cannot be known by your character during a round until the "revealing condition" happens. This also means that your character cannot do things based on "shielded" information. Knowing or acting on something that is shielded before the revealing condition is met is referred to as metagaming.

  Revealing conditions reveal the shielded information for the round, not for a specific instance. This means that once a revealing condition is met in a round, the shield no longer applies in any case for the remainder of the round.

  ## Never Revealed IC
  Some shields are never revealed IC. This means that your character can never act as if they know about that shielded thing.

  The following are shielded:
  - Current game mode and possible antags during the current game mode.
  - Events from previous rounds.
  - Events you experienced as a different character.
  - All information related to the player of a character rather than the character itself. (See "Metafriending and Metagrudging" below.)
  - All information gained while dead or a ghost.
  - The fact that a round will end.

  This does not prevent knowing that a shift will end, but does prohibit things like preparing to kill people at central command when roleplay rules stop being enforced on LRP.

  ## Major-Scale antagonists

  The existence of any Major-Scale Antagonists (Nuclear Operatives and other Nukie-like or army antagonists, station-threatening megafauna, paranormal or extranormal threats, et cetera) beyond a myth that no one would act on is shielded. Minor-scale antagonists (most mid-round antagonists) and medium-scale antagonists (roundstart traitors, thieves, et cetera) are not shielded by this rule.

  The fact that the nuke disk must be protected and could be used by a bad actor to try to destroy the station is not shielded.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - Discovery of suspicious activity hinting at major-scale antagonist involvement.
  - Discovery of objects, notes, structures, or other paraphernalia associated with a major-scale antagonist.
  - Experiencing a situation where absolutely no other explanation is possible.
  - Being affiliated within a major-scale antagonist team, or being a specific major-scale antagonist.

  ## Implanted Implants

  Implanted implants are shielded.

  Implanters themselves and un-implanted implants are not shielded. This prohibits implant checking.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - Discovering a non-NT implanter, used or unused
  - Discovering a non-NT implant box
  - Discovering use of a non-NT implant by anyone
  - Experiencing a situation where absolutely no other explanation is possible
  - Discovering an unlocked uplink

  ## Chameleon Items

  Chameleon items are shielded.

  Being suspicious of an item being fake or stolen is not shielded, but testing items or calling them chameleon is covered by this shield.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - Seeing someone else cause any chameleon item to change
  - Finding holographic nanomachine fibers
  - Experiencing a situation where absolutely no other explanation is possible
  - Discovering an unlocked uplink

  ## Stealth Items

  The fact that an item can be something other than what its visual appearance and examine description indicate is shielded.

  This shield protects stealth items, including protecting them from being tested.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - Seeing the item behave differently than the expected behavior for the item
  - Seeing the item used for its hidden purpose
  - Experiencing a situation where absolutely no other explanation is possible
  - Discovering an unlocked uplink

  ## Explicitly Not Shielded
  The following is a list of things that are explicitly not shielded. If something is not on this list, it doesn't mean that it is shielded, but if something is on it then it definitely is not shielded.
  - The fact that the nuke disk must be protected and could be used by a bad actor to try to destroy the station.
  - Items that are of high value or are desired by the Syndicate, and therefore are likely targets of theft.
  - The idea that any Syndicate agent or other bad actor has goals or objectives that they are attempting to accomplish.
  - The number of goals or objectives that a Syndicate agent or other bad actor has.
  - The fact that the Syndicate are enemies of Nanotrasen, and that they regularly attempt to send covert agents to spy on, sabotage, or attack Nanotrasen.
  - A character's typical appearance. Though you should keep in mind that multiple characters can share the same name.
  - The fact that the Syndicate have covert items capable of getting items to them, and that these items are known as uplinks.
